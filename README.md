# Goldie: Your Hydration Companion

Goldie, the companion goldfish, is here to help you stay hydrated! This project tracks your daily water intake by visually representing the water level.  The water level decreases over time and increases each time you log a glass of water.

## About

Goldie uses an ESP8266 for cost-effectiveness and features a 240x240 TFT display for charming animations of Goldie.  An RGB LED provides visual feedback, and a touch sensor allows for easy user interaction.
